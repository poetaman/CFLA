CFLA v1.0 ("Collective Friendliness License Addendum" version 1.0)
extends an existing license in an open or closed-source
project with an ethical (friendliness) addendum
expressed in the spirit of the words below.
If found in a repository, it must be retained in
the copies of work, and it's forks of any form.

CFLA v1.0 wants the users of the repository it is found in
to use the work in that repository such that:

a) work shall not be used to promote separation, and
   segregation of humans in antagonistic or
   privileged-undermined sets/groups
   
b) work shall not be used to benefit preferences of
   one group of humans at expense of preferences of another.
   Except if one group has tendencies not promotive of collective
   wellbeing. Example: stone-pelting of any form, even if it
   has precedence in one's religion, is not considered a
   tendency promotive of collective wellbeing. In such case, work
   can be used to benefit preferences of one group (that prefers
   no stone pelting to be performed) over preferences of another

c) work shall not be used to promote harm/killings
   of any humans or other animals

d) work shall not be used to enable or promote
   or perform trade involving:
       - Slavery of any kind
       - Addictive substances or services
       - Whole or part of dead bodies of any species
       - Poisons or herbicides that destroy plant or animal life
       - Weapons of mass destruction

e) work shall not be used to promote beliefs on 
   phenomena that are neither directly observable nor 
   inferable from prior direct observations. Example:
   your belief that one conception of God/divine is 
   exclusively true, and rest are false is not to be promoted
   using contents of this repository or its copies/forks

f) work shall not be used for promoting, expressing, 
   or perpetuating greed, hatred, or delusion of any kind
   not expressly covered in the prior clauses.
   On the contrary one can use work to promote
   sharing, generosity, friendliness, useful truths or
   belief-based practices known to promote collective health,
   happiness, comforts, and peace.

Any violation of above mentioned clauses nullifies any
license this addendum is found with, a) in extension of
clauses to such effect already mentioned in that license
file itself, b) even if no clause of nullification is
mentioned in the license this addendum extends.
