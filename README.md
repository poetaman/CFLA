# CFLA (Collective Friendliness License Addendum)
CFLA stands for "Collective Friendliness License Addendum". It aims to be a concise ethical (friendliness) addendum to existing open or closed-source licenses. It is currently in its version 1.0 state. In future, another version might be made available if there is a compelling point made from community.

# Why not just a FOSS license?
FOSS (Free and Open Source) licenses with their statements like "The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose" fails at inspiring the world to be a better place. Perhaps it was reflective of the guilt of the creators of FOSS (who maybe do not ever want to improve as individuals). CFLA intends to make open source a medium to inspire a better world, which FOSS licenses fail at.

# Why this ethics business?
FOSS licenses also deal with questions of ethics, but only the ones that mattered to them (and their funding/collaborating corporations/institutions).

Either the vision of creating a better world never occured to the creator of FOSS licenses, or when faced with the option of choosing between popularity of their license or other benefits for themselves, and ethics of the license, they chose benefits for themselves.

# Why friendliness in name instead of "ethics"?
Ethics is a basterdized term, which has been hijacked by people to justify their own unfriendly behavior at times. People who are genuniely working on the questions of ethics would sooner or later come to the conclusion that they want the world to be a more friendly place. Moreover, friendship is the only unblemished relationship. You might have heard of parental trauma, relationship trauma, workplace trauma, battelfield trauma, etc. Have you ever heard of the term friendliness trauma? No, because its a mostly unspoken contract/license that just works.

CFLA v1.0 ("Collective Friendliness License Addendum" version 1.0)
extends an existing license in an open or closed-source
project with an ethical (friendliness) addendum
expressed in the spirit of the words below.
If found in a repository, it must be retained in
the copies of work, and it's forks of any form.

CFLA v1.0 wants the users of the repository it is found in
to use the work in that repository such that:

a) work shall not be used to promote separation, and
   segregation of humans in antagonistic or
   privileged-undermined sets/groups
   
b) work shall not be used to benefit preferences of
   one group of humans at expense of preferences of another.
   Except if one group has tendencies not promotive of collective
   wellbeing. Example: stone-pelting of any form, even if it
   has precedence in one's religion, is not considered a
   tendency promotive of collective wellbeing. In such case, work
   can be used to benefit preferences of one group (that prefers
   no stone pelting to be performed) over preferences of another

c) work shall not be used to promote harm/killings
   of any humans or other animals

d) work shall not be used to enable or promote
   or perform trade involving:
       - Slavery of any kind
       - Addictive substances or services
       - Whole or part of dead bodies of any species
       - Poisons or herbicides that destroy plant or animal life
       - Weapons of mass destruction

e) work shall not be used to promote beliefs on 
   phenomena that are neither directly observable nor 
   inferable from prior direct observations. Example:
   your belief that one conception of God/divine is 
   exclusively true, and rest are false is not to be promoted
   using contents of this repository or its copies/forks

f) work shall not be used for promoting, expressing, 
   or perpetuating greed, hatred, or delusion of any kind
   not expressly covered in the prior clauses.
   On the contrary one can use work to promote
   sharing, generosity, friendliness, useful truths or
   belief-based practices known to promote collective health,
   happiness, comforts, and peace.

Any violation of above mentioned clauses nullifies any
license this addendum is found with, a) in extension of
clauses to such effect already mentioned in that license
file itself, b) even if no clause of nullification is
mentioned in the license this addendum extends.
